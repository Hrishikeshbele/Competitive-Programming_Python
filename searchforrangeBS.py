'''
Given a sorted array of integers, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithmâ€™s runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

Example:

Given [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10] and target value 8,

return [3, 4].
