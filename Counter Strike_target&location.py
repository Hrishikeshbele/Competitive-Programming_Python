'''
Navi is a counter strike pro. He always say how good he is at counter strike. After being tired of Navi, his friends decided to test his skills at shooting. 
They put M targets on a  x-y plane, each target is denoted by (X, Y) where X is x-coordinate and Y is y-coordinate. 
His friends also gave him N locations on  plane from where Navi can shoot the targets. Navi knows that he can shoot a target if Manhattan distance between his location and target is â‰¤ D. 
If Navi can shoot more than half of the targets (for odd values of M check only for the integral part of half of M, say , ) only then his friends believe that he is a pro at counter strike otherwise he is not.

SAMPLE INPUT 
1
3 3 5
1 1
2 2
3 3
1 0
0 0
2 0
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
YES
Explanation
First location is at 1,1 , we can shot any of the given targets from here so count> 3/2, therefore YES.
'''
#first we store the the values on location and target in different arrays then we calculate manhattan distance between each position and 
# and target value's if distance is <d we increase the count. if count> target arr length/2 we print yes.
