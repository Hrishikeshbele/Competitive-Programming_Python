'''
There are N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line. 
Each hole can accomodate only 1 mouse. 
A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1. Any of these moves consumes 1 minute.
Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.
'''
#basic idea here is to sort the both arrays so that we get minimum distance for each mice
'''
Proof of correctness:
Let i1 < i2 be the positions of two mice and let j1 < j2 be the positions of two holes. It suffices to show via case analysis that

max(|i1-j1|, |i2-j2|) <= max(|i1-j2|, |i2-j1|), 
   where '|a - b|' represent absolute value of (a - b)
