'''
Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Example 1:

Input: 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.
----------------------
The idea is:
The ZERO comes from 10.
The 10 comes from 2 x 5
And we need to account for all the products of 5 and 2. likes 4Ã—5 = 20 ...
So, if we take all the numbers with 5 as a factor, we'll have way more than enough even numbers to pair with them to get factors of 10
Example One:
How many multiples of 5 are between 1 and 23? There is 5, 10, 15, and 20, for four multiples of 5. Paired with 2's from the even factors,
this makes for four factors of 10, so: 23! has 4 zeros.
We add a trailing zero every time we multiply by 10 (5 * 2). Since we will have always more 2s multiple than 5s, the problem is to find the number of 5s in the numbers from 1 to n.
Let's consider 10! as example:
10! = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
