> this folder contains codes related to OOPS concepts.
> Consider a module to be the same as a python file. A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
> class variable is shared by all class objects created.its value will be same for all objs.
> private variable is accessible within same class only, you can't access it from different class.private methods work same as private vars.(use __ convection to declare private var,methods) 
> main goal of Abstraction is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity
> Encapsulation: language mechanism for restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
> in inheritance, when we call method using child class obj then it searches for it in child class first and if not present then it 
 searches for it in parents class.
> if you pass 2 values to class constructor var with same obj name then 2nd val will overwrite 1st val like int var.(a = A(10);a = A(20) o/t: 20)
> super().__init__() : call contructor of parents class 
> (object) is parent class of all the classses we create in python. object class has buildin init constructor.there is special functn in object class called __str__() which contain code to convert object into string for printing.
> in multiple inheritance case, search for functns,atrbs happens as depth-first, left to right in parents classes
> abstract class have atleast one abstract method.An abstraction denotes the essential characteristics of an object that distinguish it from all other kinds of objects.abstraction will show most necessry details to user and hide other details.
> abstact methods are not implemented in abstract class they are only defined there and implemented in child class of abstract class. we can't create obj for abstract class directly.
> Data attributes:Variable owned by a particular instance of a class (intialised inside init) , Class(static) attributes:Owned by the  whole class . shared by all class instances.
> Dynamic Binding: The code associated with a given procedure is not known until the time of the call at run time.
> method overlaoding: method will behave differently based on input passed to it.
> data overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters. 
> Polymorphism means the ability to take various forms.Polymorphism refers to the ability of the function with the same name to carry different functionality altogether.
> isinstance consider inheritance (an instance of a derived class is an instance of a base class, too), while checking for equality of type does not (it demands identity of types and rejects instances of subtypes, AKA subclasses).
