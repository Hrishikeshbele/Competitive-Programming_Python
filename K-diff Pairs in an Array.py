'''
Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array. Here a k-diff pair is defined as an integer pair (i, j), where i and j are both numbers in the array and their absolute difference is k.

Example 1:
Input: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).
Although we have two 1s in the input, we should only return the number of unique pairs.

from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def findPairs(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
		#If k is less than 0, then the result is 0 since we are looking fpr pairs with an ABSOLUTE difference of k.
        if k < 0:
            return 0
        
        count = Counter(nums)
        pairs = set([])
        
        for num in count.keys():
			#Special case: If k == 0, then there needs to be at least two occurences of a particular num in nums 
			#in order for there to be a pair (num, num).
            if k == 0:
                if count[num] > 1:
                    pairs.add((num, num))
					
			#Regular case: k != 0. Simply check if num + k is a member of the array nums.
			#Insert the pair into the set of pairs (smallerNum, largerNum) so that there are no duplicate pairs.
            else:
                otherNum = num + k
                if otherNum in count:
                    pairs.add((num, otherNum) if num <= otherNum else (otherNum, num))
                    
        return len(pairs)
